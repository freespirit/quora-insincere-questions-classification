# Kernels
This subdirectory is a simple container for kernels developed in the kaggle's interface. Due to the nature of the jupiter notebooks and their text representation it's hard to keep track of the changes, so experimental development would be made in the main directory, in simple py scripts, and this directory would just keep an archive of finished kernels
